To localise wireless device in indoor setting, we can utilise CSI data from access points which we can get using SLAM techniques. Each accesspoint has inconsistant offset and need to be dealt with.

## Transformation:
convert SxA Matrix  to a heatmap using 2D-FFT

## Encoder
The encoder, E : H → ˆH , takes in the input
heatmaps, H , corresponding to all the APs in the environment and
generates a concise representation

## 2 Step Approach:
### Step 1:
#### Location
The location decoder, Dlocat ion : ˆH → Ylocation takes
in the encoder representation, ˆH and outputs an estimate for the
location, Ylocation.
### Step 2:
#### Consitency
The consistency decoder, Dconsistency : ˆH → Yconsistency ensures that the network
sees a consistent view of the environment across different training
samples as well as across different access points. Where Yconsistency
are output heatmaps, Y i
consistency corresponding to all the APs (say
NAP ).
