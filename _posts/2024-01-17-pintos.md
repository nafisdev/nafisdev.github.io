To understand operating system , pintos provides an interactive test environment to understand fundamentals in an amicable manner. There are 4 projects and as we progress , we'll build intuition for the practicality of thread , semaphore, scheduling , process management 
<br>

## Setup:
Use VScode extension [dev containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
it will enable debugging the server remotely from local machine

## Project 1: 

### Stage 1:
alarm-single
alarm-multiple
alarm-simultaneous
alarm-zero
alarm-negative

TODO: Replace busy wait with more effient approach.

LEARN: Concepts of busy wait, semaphore, lock, thread structure
### Stage 2:
priority-change
priority-preempt
priority-fifo
priority-sema
priority-condvar
priority-donate-one
priority-donate-multiple
priority-donate-multiple2
priority-donate-nest
priority-donate-chain
priority-donate-sema
priority-donate-lower
alarm-priority

TODO: Implement priority scheduling

LEARN: 


### Stage 3:
TODO: Multilevel Feedback Queue

LEARN: How to achieve fairness in Roundrobin scheduling ny utilising parameters

<br>

## Project 2:
1. Parse Argument and push to INTR frame stack pointer
2. Extract argument from interupt frame in syscall
3. Parametrize the arguments with respective types and call specific system calls. responsibilty is delegated to system calls that runs at kernel level
