The year 2021 was prolifirated with lots of learning. I started with Azure DevOps and ending it with Angular12. In the middle , i enrolled for a [data scientist program](https://github.com/nafisdev/dataquest) and now i can promote myself in DataScience segment to be considered as a better novice. Didnt have any resolution for 2021, but eventually clocked a decent progress. As I always tried to dig deeper wherever i found things fascinating, I found a great blog to brush my understanding of OS [3 easy pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). There were some brushup in my coding skills too. thanks to leetcode. With all of this, I have realised that a lot of things need to be done in my personal life too.
